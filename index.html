            The console screen allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.
            You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. 
            You can also use Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS), or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux) to open up the console screen.
